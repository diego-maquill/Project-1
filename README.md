What Users Are Searching For Locally
In an effort to try and understand what end users are actually looking for, when it comes to local, I went to Google Adwords, and using their keyword tool I pulled the top 50 things people search for using Google, and included the word “local”:

local news

local pubs

local pizza
Of course this represents a conscious search using the word “local” and not just typing pizza and relying on their location to localize the results.  But it still gives good insight into what people are looking for when searching locally, and hopefully we can work to build more local web and mobile applications that deliver these results for user.
